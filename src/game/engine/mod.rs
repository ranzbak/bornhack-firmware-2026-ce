//! Cyber Ægg game engine — delta-T progression with boundary-based wake
//! scheduling.
//!
//! Instead of ticking every 10 seconds, the engine:
//! 1. Computes elapsed ticks since the last update.
//! 2. Applies all stat changes for that delta in one step.
//! 3. Computes the next boundary crossing time across all stats.
//! 4. Schedules a wake-up at the next visible change (or MAX_SLEEP_TICKS()).
//!
//! This lets the CPU sleep for minutes or hours when nothing interesting
//! is about to happen, saving significant battery on the badge.

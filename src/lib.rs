//! Firmware library for the BornHack CyberÆgg badge — an nRF52840-based
//! e-paper / LoRa / BLE / NFC pet-and-mesh companion device.
//!
//! # Hardware target
//!
//! - **MCU** — Nordic nRF52840 (Cortex-M4F + radio + USB + NFC).
//! - **Display** — SSD1675 152×152 tri-color e-paper over SPI3.
//! - **LoRa radio** — Semtech SX1262 over SPI2, MeshCore protocol.
//! - **BLE** — softdevice via `nrf-sdc` / `trouble-host`.
//! - **NFC** — built-in NFCT controller; emulates an ISO 14443-A Type 4 tag
//!   with authenticated station commands (`signed_channel`).
//!
//! # Bin targets (`src/bin/`)
//!
//! - **`embassy`** — main firmware. Built with the `embassy*` features.
//! - **`simulator`** — desktop SDL2 UI simulator.  Built with `simulator`.
//! - **`simulate_game`** — headless game-balance simulator that runs all player
//!   profiles and prints a summary table matching the Python sim.
//! - **`hwtest`** — standalone factory hardware test.  Skips this library
//!   entirely (the `#![cfg]` gate below makes the lib content empty for it) so
//!   it links without dragging in the full graphics/menu stack.
//!
//! # Feature gates
//!
//! Compose to keep the flash budget under control on the 960 KiB app
//! partition:
//!
//! - `embassy-base` — async runtime, EPD driver, buttons, buzzer, kv, watch
//!   face, signed-channel NFC.  Always on for any firmware build.
//! - `embassy-watch` — `embassy-base` only (smallest fw configuration).
//! - `embassy-game` — `embassy-base` + virtual pet game + USB-MSC.
//! - `embassy-mesh` — `embassy-base` + LoRa mesh + BLE companion.
//! - `embassy` — full build = base + game + mesh + USB-MSC.
//! - `simulator` — host-side build with SDL2 rendering and `std`.
//! - `signed-channel` — Ed25519 challenge/response NFC station auth.
//!
//! # Module map
//!
//! - `fw` — driver-layer code: EPD, buzzer, battery ADC, button matrix, LEDs,
//!   NFC tag, LoRa radio, BLE companion, MeshCore plumbing, FAT12 reader,
//!   ekv-backed kv store, sponsors slideshow.  Embassy only.
//! - `game` — virtual-pet lifecycle (hunger / inspiration / health /
//!   tiredness), mini-games (black-hole, NIM, lights-out, tic-tac-toe,
//!   sprite engine), station bonuses, action-feedback toasts.  Gated by `game`.
//! - `watch` — Casio-style digital + analog clock face, alarms with per-day
//!   mask and weekly repeats, multi-slot alarm state.  Gated by `watch`.
//! - `menu` — declarative `MenuItem` / `MenuItemKind` items, the icon- grid
//!   `DisplayState`, and the scrolling 3-row menu renderer.  Always built.
//! - `text_entry` — full-screen quadrant-style on-screen keyboard for text
//!   input (node names, channel replies, etc.).
//! - `signed_channel` — Ed25519 challenge/response verification used by the NFC
//!   station-command flow.  Gated by `signed-channel`.
//! - `ui` — common drawing helpers (frame, layout constants).
//!
//! # Bootloader
//!
//! A custom USB-DFU bootloader (`nrf-aegg-bootloader`, in the
//! `bootloader/` directory) replaces the factory Adafruit UF2 stub.  It
//! lives at `0x00000000`–`0x0000FFFF` (64 KiB) and hands off to the app
//! at `0x00010000`.  The main app's `memory-fw.x` accordingly sets
//! `FLASH ORIGIN = 0x00010000` and `LENGTH = 960K`.  The bootloader is a
//! standalone Cargo project, *not* in this workspace and *not* tracked
//! in git — see the README for build steps.

// The library only has meaningful content when building the main firmware
// or simulator. Other binaries (e.g. `hwtest`) build against an empty
// library so their builds don't drag in the full graphics/menu stack.

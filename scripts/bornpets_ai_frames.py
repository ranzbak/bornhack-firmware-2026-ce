"""Generate bornpets sprite-sheet frames with the OpenAI image API.

Pipeline (one frame at a time, so a bad frame can be regenerated alone):

    gen       panda frame -> upscaled reference PNG -> /v1/images/edits
              -> raw 1024x1024 RGBA PNG in <work>/raw/
    quantize  raw PNG -> alpha-trim -> rescale to the panda frame's bbox
              -> 3-colour palette (black/white/red) + transparency
              -> <work>/frames/
    assemble  <work>/frames/ -> paste into the pet's sheet PNG

BORNPETS_PET picks the pet (default: badger); its prompts live in PROFILES.
Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in the environment. Network calls go through `curl`
(multipart upload); no third-party Python packages beyond Pillow.

    python3 scripts/bornpets_ai_frames.py gen --only badger_idle_0

    "small black nose; two broad BLACK STRIPES that start beside the nose, run "
    "up over each eye and continue back over the crown to the ears, with a "
    "white blaze between them and white cheeks outside them; big round shiny "
    "eyes inside the stripes, each ringed in white with a white highlight dot; "
    "plain white cheeks with NO red blush - nothing red on the face; small "
    "rounded black ears with white "
    "rims; a stocky SOLID BLACK body and short legs with a WHITE belly patch; "
    "a short bushy tail; and the line weight. The EYES always sit INSIDE the "
    "black stripes and must always be visible there: an open eye has a white "
    "ring around its black pupil, and a closed, squinting or sleeping eye is "
    "drawn as a bold WHITE curved line or white X on the black stripe - never "
    "black on black, and never moved out onto the white cheeks. It must never look like a panda: "
    "no round black eye patches, no white body. Anyone must recognise it as "
    "the same badger in every frame."

    "badger's posture, expression, camera framing and any props or background "
    "objects that best tell the viewer what is happening. Be playful and "
    "characterful - this is a virtual-pet game, and the scene should read "
    "instantly at a glance. Badger-native props are encouraged where they suit "
    "the scene: earthworms and grubs for food, its underground sett, loose soil "

    "actually calls for it - do not put a moon in every frame."

STYLE_TEMPLATE = (
    "Style: chunky hard-edged 1-bit retro pixel art for a monochrome e-ink "
    "virtual-pet game, matching image 1's line weight exactly. Use ONLY pure "

    "artwork - no grey, no other colours, no anti-aliasing, no shading, no "
    "gradients. The art is WHITE-DOMINANT: shapes are filled solid white and "
    "black is used only for outlines, {markings} and small "
    "details. Red is a bold accent used sparingly, in chunky solid shapes "
    "at least 3 pixels thick - never thin red hairlines, they disappear when the "
    "sprite is scaled down.\n\n"
    "THERE IS NO BACKGROUND AND NO SCENERY. Do not draw a sky, ground, floor, "
    "horizon, wall, room, landscape, backdrop or panel border. The character and "
    "its props float on the empty magenta chroma key, which fills every pixel "
    "that is not the character or a prop and is used nowhere else. Props are "
    "small discrete objects placed next to or touching the character, drawn as "
    "white shapes with thin black outlines.\n\n"
    "NEVER fill a large area with solid black. Black is only for thin outlines, "

    "part of the character and stays black.\n\n"

The bank is white so it stays visible; the hole is the only black shape in it. A few white lumps of dug-out soil are scattered in front of the hole.\n(2) RIGHT FOREGROUND: a wooden signboard on a post leaning at a slight angle, stuck into the ground and standing taller than the bank - a white rectangular plank with the words FOR RENT in black pixel capitals.\n(3) A couple of grass tufts on top of the bank.\nNothing else at all.
